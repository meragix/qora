title: Overview
description: Inspect queries, mutations, cache and optimistic updates in real time — directly in your IDE or inside your running app.

Qora ships with first-class developer tooling across two independent surfaces. Both share the same event protocol and work without any configuration changes to your production code.

  to: /devtools/overlay
  ---
  A draggable panel that lives inside your running app — inspired by TanStack Query's overlay. Zero overhead in release builds.

  title: IDE Extension

  to: /devtools/ide-extension
  ---
  A native tab inside Flutter DevTools. Works in VS Code and IntelliJ. Inspect the full cache and send commands directly from your IDE.

## Comparison

| | In-App Overlay | IDE Extension |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Wrap your app with `QoraInspector` | Add `qora_devtools_extension` to dependencies |
| **Where it runs** | Inside your app | Inside Flutter DevTools (VS Code / IntelliJ) |
| **Transport** | Direct — same process | Dart VM Service (WebSocket) |
| **Mutations timeline** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Cache inspector** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Optimistic updates** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Refetch / Invalidate** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Widget Tree** | — | ✅ |
| **Data Diff** | — | ✅ |
| **Production overhead** | None (`kDebugMode` guard) | None (stripped by tree-shaker) |
| **Works on physical device** | ✅ | ✅ (via USB) |

## How it works

Both surfaces listen to the same stream of events produced by `QoraTracker` — an interface implemented by your `QueryClient`. In production, a `NoOpTracker` is injected automatically, which means **zero overhead, zero dead code in your release bundle**.

```
QueryClient
    │
    ├── NoOpTracker (production)     → silent, inlined away by the compiler
    ├── VmTracker  (IDE extension)   → pushes events over Dart VM Service
    └── OverlayTracker (overlay)     → pushes events directly in-memory
```

You never interact with trackers directly. They are injected based on which DevTools package is present in your dependency tree.
