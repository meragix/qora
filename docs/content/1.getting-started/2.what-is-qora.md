**Qora** is a modern server state management library for Dart and Flutter, inspired by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) and optimized for the Dart/Flutter ecosystem.

## Why Qora?

Server state is fundamentally different from local UI state — it lives remotely, can become stale, and must be synchronized with your app. Qora handles all of that for you:

- **Cache** data intelligently and serve it instantly on repeat visits
- **Revalidate** stale data in the background without blocking the UI
- **Deduplicate** concurrent requests for the same key into a single network call
- **Retry** failed requests automatically with exponential backoff
- **Invalidate** targeted cache entries after mutations, triggering reactive refetches

## Core API

### One-shot fetch

```dart [user_repository.dart]
final user = await client.fetchQuery<User>(
  key: ['users', userId],
  fetcher: () => api.getUser(userId),
  options: const QoraOptions(staleTime: Duration(minutes: 5)),
);
```

Cache behaviour: fresh data is returned immediately with no network call; stale data is returned immediately while a background refetch is dispatched.

### Reactive stream

```dart [user_repository.dart]
client.watchQuery<User>(
  key: ['users', userId],
  fetcher: () => api.getUser(userId),
).listen((state) {
  switch (state) {
    case Success(:final data):  render(data);
    case Failure(:final error): showError(error);
    default: {}
  }
});
```

### Invalidation after mutation

```dart [post_repository.dart]
await api.createPost(payload);

// Invalidate exact key
client.invalidate(['posts', postId]);

// Invalidate by predicate
client.invalidateWhere((key) => key.firstOrNull == 'posts');
```

### Optimistic updates

```dart [user_repository.dart]
final snapshot = client.getState<User>(['users', userId]);
client.setQueryData(['users', userId], user.copyWith(name: newName));

try {
  await api.updateUser(userId, newName);
} catch (_) {
  client.restoreQueryData(['users', userId], snapshot);
}
```

## Architecture

Qora is organized as two complementary packages:

### `qora` — Pure Dart core

Zero Flutter dependencies. Works in any Dart environment:

- CLI tools and scripts
- Backend Dart services
- Unit tests without Flutter test runner
- Shared business logic packages

### `flutter_qora` — Flutter integration

A thin widget layer on top of `qora`:

- `QoraScope` — `InheritedWidget` that provides the client to the tree
- `QoraBuilder<T>` — fetches and reactively rebuilds on every state change
- `QoraStateBuilder<T>` — observes state without triggering a fetch
- `FlutterLifecycleManager` — refetch on app resume
- `FlutterConnectivityManager` — refetch on network reconnect
- `context.qora` — shorthand extension for `QoraScope.of(context)`

---

## Design Philosophy

### Declarative, not imperative

You describe *what* to render for each state. Qora handles *when* to fetch, cache, and revalidate.

### Type-safe by default

`QoraState<T>` is a sealed class. The Dart compiler enforces exhaustive pattern matching — no forgotten states, no runtime surprises.

### Smart defaults, full control

Sensible defaults (5-minute stale time, 3 retries, exponential backoff) that you can override globally or per-query with `QoraOptions`.

## How It Compares

| Feature                   | Qora | Provider | BLoC    | Riverpod |
| ------------------------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Automatic cache           | ✅   | ❌       | ❌      | ✅       |
| Stale-while-revalidate    | ✅   | ❌       | ❌      | ❌       |
| Request deduplication     | ✅   | ❌       | ❌      | ✅       |
| Optimistic updates        | ✅   | Partial  | Partial | Partial  |
| Automatic retry           | ✅   | ❌       | ❌      | ❌       |
| Exhaustive state matching | ✅   | ❌       | Partial | Partial  |

## Ideal Use Cases

Qora excels at:

- **CRUD applications** — users, products, orders with reactive list and detail screens
- **Social feeds** — posts, likes, and comments that stay in sync across the app
- **Dashboards** — polling for real-time data with background revalidation
- **E-commerce** — cart and checkout flows with optimistic UI

---

## Requirements

- Dart **3.5.0** or later
- Flutter **3.10.0** or later (for `flutter_qora` only)
